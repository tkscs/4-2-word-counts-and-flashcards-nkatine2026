Belong
Kehillah commits to creating and holding a welcoming space for all students to
come as they are, express their diverse identities, build community, and forge
meaning relationships with faculty and peers. We understand that a sense of
belonging is the foundation for deep learning, risk-taking, and individuality.
As we create this space for each student, they can help create it for others.

Build

Learning at Kehillah is not a passive act --- it's a co-constructed cycle of
discovery, challenge, and growth. Our expert faculty, deeply attuned to
adolescent development and progressive education practices, partner with
students to build academic prowess, self-refleciton, agency, wellness,
character, and joy.

Become

Kehillah is a launchpad for purpose. Our graduates leave not just prepared for
top universities, but as compassionate individuals who define success through
achievement, contribution, and character. Grounded in curiosity and integrity,
they are ready to navigate complexity, think critically, and drive meaningful
change in their communities and beyond.
